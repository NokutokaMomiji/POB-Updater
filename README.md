# Project: One Bullet - Launcher
So, in order to avoid the hassle of having you people access the private GitHub repository and download the newest releases manually, I decided to just make a Updater / Launcher program that downloads the latest build when I publish it.
<br><br>
I also used this as an oportunity to use C# rather than Python or something. Why? Because C# is cool, man.
<br><br>

## Usage
1. On the left side of the site, click on the latest release.
1. Scroll down and download the ZIP file named `Launcher.zip`.
1. After the file has downloaded, **right-click** the file and select the `Extract` option.
1. Click the `Extract` button at the bottom of the dialogue. The window with the extracted files will open.
1. **Double-click** on the `Launcher.exe` program. **This is what you should open each time you wish to enter the game.**
1. If nothing happens or you get a virus alert, **IT IS FAKE**. Do not worry, just fish the file out of quarantine and create an exception for it. This happens because the program is not signed by Microsoft.
1. Chances are you will see a **Windows Defender SmartScreen** popup come on. Click on the text that says <ins>`More info`</ins>, then click the button at the bottom that says "`Run anyway.`".
1. The program will run. If there is an update, it will ask you whether you want to update or not.
1. If for any reason the game becomes corrupted, just re-extract the `Launcher.zip` file to get the game files back.
1. If any problems occur, let me know and I will fix the program and send you a fixed version.
